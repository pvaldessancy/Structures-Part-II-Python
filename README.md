# Repository: Python Programming Exercises

This repository presents two Python programming exercises, each designed to challenge and enhance your Python programming skills.

## Exercise 1: Fruits Dictionary Manipulation
Description: In this exercise, you will work with a list of fruits to create a dictionary. You will perform the following actions:

- Create a dictionary based on a list of fruits.
- Create a new list.
- Print the 5th element of the list.
- Print elements from the 4th to the 6th, inclusive.
- Delete the 3rd element.
- Add two new elements to the list of fruits, ensuring there are no duplicates and handling case sensitivity.

Purpose: This exercise focuses on manipulating data structures like dictionaries and lists. It also involves user input validation and handling.

## Exercise 2: Craft Beer Factory Data Analysis
Description: In this exercise, you will work with a dataset of 1000 measures of alcohol percentages in batches from a craft beer factory. Your tasks include:

- Calculate the mean (average) alcohol percentage.
- Calculate the standard deviation of the alcohol percentages.
- Determine the lower and upper limits for acceptable alcohol percentages.
- Create a Gaussian bell curve graph to visualize the data distribution.
- Identify and analyze outliers in the dataset.

Purpose: This exercise is centered around data analysis and statistics. It also includes data visualization using graphs.
